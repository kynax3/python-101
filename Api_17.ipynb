    "#Interoperability: APIs provide a standard way for different applications and services to communicate with each other, making it easier to integrate\n",
    "#and share data across systems.\n",
    "#Scalability: APIs are designed to be scalable, meaning they can handle a large volume of requests without compromising performance.\n",
    "#Flexibility: APIs provide developers with the flexibility to choose the programming language, platform, or framework that best suits their needs.\n",

    "#Complexity: Developing and maintaining an API can be complex, requiring significant resources and expertise.\n",
    "#Dependence: Applications that rely on APIs can become dependent on them, which can create a risk of vendor lock-in.\n",
